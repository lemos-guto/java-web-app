        <br>How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
        <br>Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
        <br>Without a soul (soul), my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
        <br>Until you find it there and lead it back home
        <br>wake me up inside
        <br>(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
        <br>(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
        <br>(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
        <br>(I can't wake up) before I come undone
        <br>(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become
        <br>Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
        <br>Breathe into me and make me real
        <br>Bring (bring) me (me) to life
        <br>wake me up inside
        <br>(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
        <br>(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
        <br>(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
        <br>(I can't wake up) before I come undone
        <br>(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become
        <br>Bring me to life
        <br>I've been living a lie
        <br>There's nothing inside
        <br>Bring me to life
        <br>Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
        <br>Darling, only you are the life among the dead
        <br>All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
        <br>Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
        <br>I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
        <br>Got to open my eyes to everything
        <br>Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
        <br>Don't let me die here, there must be something more
        <br>Bring me to life
        <br>wake me up inside
        <br>(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
        <br>(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
        <br>(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
        <br>(I can't wake up) before I come undone
        <br>(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become
        <br>Bring me to life
        <br>I've been living a lie (bring me to life)
        <br>There's nothing inside
        <br>Bring me to life
